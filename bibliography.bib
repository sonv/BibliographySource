We propose a definition for the weak time derivative that does not rely on the availability of a Hilbertian structure and explore conditions under which spaces of weakly differentiable functions (with values in an evolving Banach space) relate to classical Sobolev–Bochner spaces. An Aubin–Lions compactness result is proved. We analyse concrete examples of function spaces over time-evolving spatial domains and hypersurfaces for which we explicitly provide the definition of the time derivative and verify isomorphism properties with the aforementioned Sobolev–Bochner spaces. We conclude with the proof of well posedness for a class of nonlinear monotone problems on an abstract evolving space (generalising the evolutionary p-Laplace equation on a moving domain or surface) and identify some additional problems that can be formulated with the setting developed in this work.},

  abstract     = {Statistical fluctuations limit the precision with which a microorganism can, in a given time T, determine the concentration of a chemoattractant in the surrounding medium. The best a cell can do is to monitor continually the state of occupation of receptors distributed over its surface. For nearly optimum performance only a small fraction of the surface need be specifically adsorbing. The probability that a molecule that has collided with the cell will find a receptor is Ns/(Ns + wa), if N receptors, each with a binding site of radius s, are evenly distributed over a cell of radius a. There is ample room for many independent systems of specific receptors. The adsorption rate for molecules of moderate size cannot be significantly enhanced by motion of the cell or by stirring of the medium by the cell. The least fractional error attainable in the determination of a concentration c is approximately (ThaD)-/2, where D is the diffusion constant of the attractant. The number of specific receptors needed to attain such precision is about a/s. Data on bacteriophage adsorption, bacterial chemotaxis, and chemotaxis in a cellular slime mold are evaluated. The chemotactic sensitivity of Escherichia coli approaches that of the cell of optimum design.},

  abstract      = {We study the convergence of entropically regularized optimal transport to optimal transport. The main result is concerned with the convergence of the associated optimizers and takes the form of a large deviations principle quantifying the local exponential convergence rate as the regularization parameter vanishes. The exact rate function is determined in a general setting and linked to the Kantorovich potential of optimal transport. Our arguments are based on the geometry of the optimizers and inspired by the use of c-cyclical monotonicity in classical transport theory. The results can also be phrased in terms of Schrödinger bridges.},

  abstract      = {Particle methods based on evolving the spatial derivatives of the solution were originally introduced to simulate reaction-diffusion processes, inspired by vortex methods for the Navier–Stokes equations. Such methods, referred to as gradient random walk methods, were extensively studied in the ’90s and have several interesting features, such as being grid free, automatically adapting to the solution by concentrating elements where the gradient is large and significantly reducing the variance of the standard random walk approach. In this work, we revive these ideas by showing how to generalize the approach to a larger class of partial differential equations, including hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. To achieve this goal, we first extend the classical Monte Carlo method to relaxation approximation of systems of conservation laws, and subsequently consider a novel particle dynamics based on the spatial derivatives of the solution. The methodology, combined with asymptotic-preserving splitting discretization, yields a way to construct a new class of gradient-based Monte Carlo methods for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. Several results in one spatial dimension for scalar equations and systems of conservation laws show that the new methods are very promising and yield remarkable improvements compared to standard Monte Carlo approaches, either in terms of variance reduction as well as in describing the shock structure.},

  abstract = {We develop a new method for estimating effective population sizes, Ne, and selection coefficients, s, from time-series data of allele frequencies sampled from a single diallelic locus. The method is based on calculating transition probabilities, using a numerical solution of the diffusion process, and assuming independent binomial sampling from this diffusion process at each time point. We apply the method in two example applications. First, we estimate selection coefficients acting on the CCR5-D32 mutation on the basis of published samples of contemporary and ancient human DNA. We show that the data are compatible with the assumption of s ¼ 0, although moderate amounts of selection acting on this mutation cannot be excluded. In our second example, we estimate the selection coefficient acting on a mutation segregating in an experimental phage population. We show that the selection coefficient acting on this mutation is \$0.43.},

  abstract     = {Partial differential equations (PDE) learning is an emerging field that combines physics and machine learning to recover unknown physical systems from experimental data. While deep learning models traditionally require copious amounts of training data, recent PDE learning techniques achieve spectacular results with limited data availability. Still, these results are empirical. Our work provides theoretical guarantees on the number of input–output training pairs required in PDE learning. Specifically, we exploit randomized numerical linear algebra and PDE theory to derive a provably data-efficient algorithm that recovers solution operators of three-dimensional uniformly elliptic PDEs from input–output data and achieves an exponential convergence rate of the error with respect to the size of the training dataset with an exceptionally high probability of success.},

  abstract     = {In 1931--1932, Erwin Schr\textbackslash o"dinger studied a hot gas Gedankenexperiment (an instance of large deviations of the empirical distribution). Schr\textbackslash o"dinger's problem represents an early example of a fundamental inference method, the so-called maximum entropy method, having roots in Boltzmann's work and being developed in subsequent years by Jaynes, Burg, Dempster, and Csisz\textbackslash a'r. The problem, known as the Schro\textbackslash "dinger bridge problem (SBP) with ``uniform"" prior, was more recently recognized as a regularization of the Monge-Kantorovich optimal mass transport (OMT) problem, leading to effective computational schemes for the latter. Specifically, OMT with quadratic cost may be viewed as a zerotemperature limit of the problem posed by Schr\textbackslash o"dinger in the early 1930s. The latter amounts to minimization of Helmholtz's free energy over probability distributions that are constrained to possess two given marginals. The problem features a delicate compromise, mediated by a temperature parameter, between minimizing the internal energy and maximizing the entropy. These concepts are central to a rapidly expanding area of modern science dealing with the so-called Sinkhorn algorithm, which appears as a special case of an algorithm first studied in the more challenging continuous space setting by the French analyst Robert Fortet in 1938--1940 specifically for Schr\textbackslash o"dinger bridges. Due to the constraint on end-point distributions, dynamic programming is not a suitable tool to attack these problems. Instead, Fortet's iterative algorithm and its discrete counterpart, the Sinkhorn iteration, permit computation of the optimal solution by iteratively solving the so-called Schro\textbackslash "dinger system. Convergence of the iteration is guaranteed by contraction along the steps in suitable metrics, such as Hilbert's projective metric.},

Electronic               contrastive local learning networks               (CLLNs) offer potentially fast, efficient, and fault-tolerant hardware for analog machine learning, but existing implementations are linear, severely limiting their capabilities. These systems differ significantly from artificial neural networks as well as the brain, so the feasibility and utility of incorporating nonlinear elements have not been explored. Here, we introduce a nonlinear CLLN—an analog electronic network made of self-adjusting nonlinear resistive elements based on transistors. We demonstrate that the system learns tasks unachievable in linear systems, including XOR (exclusive or) and nonlinear regression, without a computer. We find our decentralized system reduces modes of training error in order (mean, slope, curvature), similar to               spectral bias               in artificial neural networks. The circuitry is robust to damage, retrainable in seconds, and performs learned tasks in microseconds while dissipating only picojoules of energy across each transistor. This suggests enormous potential for fast, low-power computing in edge systems like sensors, robotic controllers, and medical devices, as well as manufacturability at scale for performing and studying emergent learning.},

  abstract     = {We develop a new Monte Carlo method that solves hyperbolic transport equations with stiff terms, characterized by a (small) scaling parameter. In particular, we focus on systems which lead to a reduced problem of parabolic type in the limit when the scaling parameter tends to zero. Classical Monte Carlo methods suffer severe time step limitations in these situations, due to the fact that the characteristic speeds go to infinity in the diffusion limit. This makes the problem a real challenge, since the scaling parameter may differ by several orders of magnitude in the domain. To circumvent these time step limitations, we construct a new, asymptotic-preserving Monte Carlo method that is stable independently of the scaling parameter and degenerates to a standard probabilistic approach for solving the limiting equation in the diffusion limit. The method uses an implicit time discretization to formulate a modified equation in which the characteristic speeds do not grow indefinitely when the scaling factor tends to zero. The resulting modified equation can readily be discretized by a Monte Carlo scheme, in which the particles combine a finite propagation speed with a time step dependent diffusion term. We show the performance of the method by comparing it with standard (deterministic) approaches in the literature.},

We proved that in the formal continuous limit, in both space and time, this new family of quantum walks converges to the (1+2)D massless Dirac equation on curved manifolds. We believe that this result has relevance in both modelling/simulating quantum transport on discrete curved structures, such as fullerene molecules or dynamical causal triangulation, and in addressing fast and efficient optimization problems in the context of the curved space optimization methods.},

  abstract     = {A set of data with positive values follows a Pareto distribution if the log–log plot of value versus rank is approximately a straight line. A Pareto distribution satisfies Zipf’s law if the log–log plot has a slope of −1. Since many types of ranked data follow Zipf’s law, it is considered a form of universality. We propose a mathematical explanation for this phenomenon based on Atlas models and first-order models, systems of strictly positive continuous semimartingales with parameters that depend only on rank. We show that the stationary distribution of an Atlas model will follow Zipf’s law if and only if two natural conditions, conservation and completeness, are satisfied. Since Atlas models and first-order models can be constructed to approximate systems of time-dependent rank-based data, our results can explain the universality of Zipf’s law for such systems. However, ranked data generated by other means may follow non-Zipfian Pareto distributions. Hence, our results explain why Zipf’s law holds for word frequency, firm size, household wealth, and city size, while it does not hold for earthquake magnitude, cumulative book sales, and the intensity of wars, all of which follow non-Zipfian Pareto distributions.},

  abstract     = {Ideas and results in the quantum theory of experiments are reviewed. To fix ideas, a concrete example of indirect measurements, an experiment devised by Guerlin et al. (Nature 448(7156):889–893, 2007), and theoretical interpretations thereof (Bauer and Bernard, Phys Rev A 84(4):044103, 2011; Bauer et al., Ann H Poincar´e 14:639–679, 2013) are recalled. Subsequently two important elements of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, viz. the von Neumann- and the Lu¨ders measurement postulates, are recalled and rendered more precise. Next, a model originally proposed by Gisin et al. (Phys Rev Lett 52:1657–1660, 1984) is described and shown to imply these postulates. It is then used to provide a theoretical description of the experiment in Guerlin et al. (Nature 448(7156):889–893, 2007) involving a “Heisenberg cut” differing from the one invoked in (Bauer and Bernard, Phys Rev A 84(4):044103, 2011; Bauer et al., Ann H Poincar´e 14:639–679, 2013; J Stat Phys 162:924–958, 2016). Some technical issues in the analysis of Gisin’s model are elaborated upon. The paper concludes with remarks on a general principle that implies a universal law governing the stochastic time evolution of states of individual physical systems featuring events and leading to a solution of the so-called measurement problem in quantum mechanics.},

  abstract     = {Monte Carlo methods are a very general and useful approach for the estimation of expectations arising from stochastic simulation. However, they can be computationally expensive, particularly when the cost of generating individual stochastic samples is very high, as in the case of stochastic PDEs. Multilevel Monte Carlo is a recently developed approach which greatly reduces the computational cost by performing most simulations with low accuracy at a correspondingly low cost, with relatively few simulations being performed at high accuracy and a high cost.             In this article, we review the ideas behind the multilevel Monte Carlo method, and various recent generalizations and extensions, and discuss a number of applications which illustrate the flexibility and generality of the approach and the challenges in developing more efficient implementations with a faster rate of convergence of the multilevel correction variance.},

Here, we scale up this approach to program networks of microscopic particles (agents) dispersed in an enzymatic solution. Agents may possess multiple stable states, thus maintaining a memory and communicate by emitting various orthogonal chemical signals, while also sensing the behaviour of neighbouring agents. Using this approach, we can produce collective behaviours involving thousands of agents, for example retrieving information over long distances or creating spatial patterns. Our systems recapitulate some fundamental mechanisms of distributed decision making and morphogenesis among living organisms and could find applications in cases where many individual clues need to be combined to reach a decision, for example in molecular diagnostics.},

The novelty of our approach compared to that of previous works is that we deal with the periodic case in its full generality.

  abstract = {The selection from a finite number of strongly continuous semigroups by means of a finite-state Markov chain leads to the new notion of a random evolution. Random evolutions are used to obtain probabilistic solutions to abstract systems of differential equations. Applications include one-dimensional first order hyperbolic systems. An important special case leads to consideration of abstract telegraph equations and a generalization of a result of Kac on the classical 7¡-dimensional telegraph equation is obtained and put in a more natural setting. In this connection a singular perturbation theorem for an abstract telegraph equation is proved by means of a novel application of the classical central limit theorem and a representation of the solution for the limiting equation is found in terms of a transformation formula involving the Gaussian distribution.},

Comprising two main parts, this book begins with the well-developed theory of particles in viscous fluids, i.e. microhydrodynamics, particularly for single- and pair-body dynamics. Part II considers many-body dynamics, covering shear flows and sedimentation, bulk flow properties and collective phenomena. An interlude between the two parts provides the basic statistical techniques needed to employ the results of the first (microscopic) in the second (macroscopic). The authors introduce theoretical, mathematical concepts through concrete examples, making the material accessible to non-mathematicians. They also include some of the many open questions in the field to encourage further study. Consequently, this is an ideal introduction for students and researchers from other disciplines who are approaching suspension dynamics for the first time.},

These ‘active carpets’ locally inject energy into their surrounding fluid. Whereas Fick’s laws of diffusion are established near equilibrium, it is unclear how to solve non-equilibrium transport driven by such boundary-actuated fluctuations. Here, we derive the enhanced diffusivity of molecules or passive particles as a function of distance from an active carpet. Following Schnitzer’s telegraph model, we then cast these results into generalised Fick’s laws. Two archetypal problems are solved using these laws: First, considering sedimentation towards an active carpet, we find a self-cleaning effect where surface-driven fluctuations can repel particles. Second, considering diffusion from a source to an active sink, say nutrient capture by suspension feeders, we find a large molecular flux compared to thermal diffusion. Hence, our results could elucidate certain non-equilibrium properties of active coating materials and life at interfaces.},

In addition we propose second order schemes combined with implicit-explicit time integrators as proper discretization of the relaxation-type system. Numerical tests are carried out on various situations in traffic flow. The results show that the proposed models are able to describe correctly the formation of backward waves induced by traffic jam.},

  abstract   = {This is a tutorial and selective review explaining the fundamental concepts and some currently open questions concerning the plasma phenomenon of the electron hole. The widespread occurrence of electron holes in numerical simulations, space-craft observations, and laboratory experiments is illustrated. The elementary underlying theory is developed of a one-dimensional electron hole as a localized potential maximum, self-consistently sustained by a deficit of trapped electron phase-space density. The spatial extent of a hole is typically a few Debye lengths; what determines the minimum and maximum possible lengths is explained, addressing the key aspects of the as yet unsettled dispute between the integral and differential approaches to hole structure. In multiple dimensions, holes tend to form less readily; they generally require a magnetic field and distribution-function anisotropy. The mechanisms by which they break up are explained, noting that this transverse instability is not fully understood. Examples are given of plasma circumstances where holes play an important role, and of recent progress on understanding their holistic kinematics and self-acceleration.},

In this paper we study a related steady version of this problem where a steadily stirred fluid is uniformly heated in the interior and cooled on the boundary. For a given large Péclet number, how should one stir to minimize some norm of the temperature? This version of the problem was previously studied by Marcotte, Doering et\textbackslash{} al.\textbackslash{} (SIAM Appl.\textbackslash{} Math '18) in a disk, where the authors used matched asymptotics to show that when the Péclet number, \textbackslash mathrmPe, is sufficiently large one can stir the fluid in a manner that ensures the total heat is O(1/\textbackslash mathrmPe). In this paper we confirm their results with rigorous proofs, and also provide an almost matching lower bound. For simplicity, we work on the infinite strip instead of the unit disk and the proof uses probabilistic techniques.},

Approximating the solutions of the Smoluchowski equations by a sequence of finite Markov chains, we investigate the qualitative behavior of the solutions. We determine a device on the finite chains which can detect the gelation phenomena – the density dropping phenomena. It shows how the gelation phenomena are reflected on the sequence of finite Markov chains. Using this device, we determine various types of gelation kernels and get the bounds of gelation times.},

The idea is to use a local relaxation approximation. We construct a linear hyperbolic system with a stiff lower order term that approximates the original system with a small dissipative correction. The new system can be solved by underresolved stable numerical discretizations without using either Riemann solvers spatially or a nonlinear system of algebraic equations solvers temporally. Numerical results for 1-D and 2-D problems are presented. The secondorder schemes are shown to be total variation diminishing (TVD) in the zero relaxation limit for scalar equations. 0 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Topics covered include weak measurements, quantum measurement reversal, quantum trajectories and the stochastic path integral formalism. The theory of quantum measurement is also covered in detail, including discussion of how it can be tested and demonstrated in a laboratory: how to build quantum-limited amplifiers, fundamental noise limits imposed on measurement by quantum mechanics, and the design of superconducting circuits. This text is an excellent introduction for students with a basic understanding of quantum mechanics wanting to learn more about measurement theory, and the inclusion of a wide selection of end-of-chapter exercises make this book ideal for emerging courses on the topic. Key chapters introducing the foundations of quantum computing and the history of measurement theory are equally accessible to a broader, less specialised audience.},

  abstract      = {We introduce a principled method to train end-to-end analog neural networks by stochastic gradient descent. In these analog neural networks, the weights to be adjusted are implemented by the conductances of programmable resistive devices such as memristors [Chua, 1971], and the nonlinear transfer functions (or ‘activation functions’) are implemented by nonlinear components such as diodes. We show mathematically that a class of analog neural networks (called nonlinear resistive networks) are energy-based models: they possess an energy function as a consequence of Kirchhoff’s laws governing electrical circuits. This property enables us to train them using the Equilibrium Propagation framework [Scellier and Bengio, 2017]. Our update rule for each conductance, which is local and relies solely on the voltage drop across the corresponding resistor, is shown to compute the gradient of the loss function. Our numerical simulations, which use the SPICEbased Spectre simulation framework to simulate the dynamics of electrical circuits, demonstrate training on the MNIST classification task, performing comparably or better than equivalent-size software-based neural networks. Our work can guide the development of a new generation of ultra-fast, compact and low-power neural networks supporting on-chip learning.},

When fast motions are hyperbolic (Axiom A) flows or diffeomorphisms (as well as expanding endomorphisms) for each freezed slow variable this form of the averaging principle was derived in [19] and [20] relying on some large deviations arguments which can be applied only in the Axiom A or uniformly expanding case. Here we give another proof which seems to work in a more general framework, in particular, when fast motions are some partially hyperbolic or some nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems or nonuniformly expanding endomorphisms.},

The method regularizes the drift coefficient within a certain class of functions and then the Euler–Maruyama scheme for the regularized scheme is used as an approximation. This methodology gives two errors. The first one is the error of regularization of the drift coefficient within a given class of parametrized functions. The second one is the error of the regularized Euler–Maruyama scheme. After an optimization procedure with respect to the parameters we obtain various rates, which improve other known results.},

  abstract      = {The timescales of many physical, chemical, and biological processes are determined by first passage times (FPTs) of diffusion. The overwhelming majority of FPT research studies the time it takes a single diffusive searcher to find a target. However, the more relevant quantity in many systems is the time it takes the fastest searcher to find a target from a large group of searchers. This fastest FPT depends on extremely rare events and has a drastically faster timescale than the FPT of a given single searcher. In this work, we prove a simple explicit formula for every moment of the fastest FPT. The formula is remarkably universal, as it holds for \$d\$-dimensional diffusion processes (i) with general space-dependent diffusivities and force fields, (ii) on Riemannian manifolds, (iii) in the presence of reflecting obstacles, and (iv) with partially absorbing targets. Our results rigorously confirm, generalize, correct, and unify various conjectures and heuristics about the fastest FPT.},

An averaging principle is shown to hold and the action component of the solution converges, as → 0, to the solution of a deterministic system of differential equations when the time is rescaled at 1/ . An estimate for the rate of the convergence is given. In the case when the perturbation is a Hamiltonian vector field, the limiting deterministic system is constant in which case we show that the action component of the solution scaled at 1/ 2 converges to that of a limiting stochastic differentiable equation.},

The microscopic description is given by the linearized ionic transport (electrokinetic) equations, including the effects of ion diffusion, electromigration and convection. Periodic homogenization is used to derive effective governing equations for the fluid velocity, ionic flux and current density that capture the macroscopic behavior. Explicit expressions for the transport coefficient tensors are given in terms of solutions to cell problems. Without any additional assumptions, we rigorously prove that these transport coefficient tensors obey certain fundamental thermodynamic requirements, namely, Onsager’s reciprocal relations and the positive definiteness of the diagonal coefficient tensors.},

  abstract     = {Avellaneda and one of the authors ([1], [3]) have recently established that an upper bound for the enhanced diffusivity in the large scale, long time advection‐diffusion with periodic steady incompressible velocity fields has the form                              where               Pe               is the Peclet number and                              is the reciprocal of the Prandtl number. In this paper, flow fields with maximal and minimal enhanced diffusion are studied. Maximal enhanced diffusion requires that in some directions the enhanced diffusion tensor also has the lower bound                              . For minimal enhanced diffusion, the effect of the velocity field is to boost the enhanced diffusivity by a negligible amount that is bounded by a fixed constant times the bare diffusivity regardless of Peclet number. Stieltjes measure formulas are used to develop a simple, necessary, and sufficient condition for maximal enhanced diffusion and also to characterize minimal enhanced diffusion.                          It is established here that constant mean flows can have a dramatic effect on maximal and minimal enhanced diffusion. In particular, for flows in two space dimensions, an explicit criterion is developed that guarantees the surprising fact that mean flows with rational ratios typically generate maximal enhanced diffusion through interaction with an arbitrary steady periodic incompressible flow with zero mean. In contrast, a simple criterion for flows without stagnation points is developed here that guarantees that the effect of mean flows with irrational ratios on advection‐diffusion in two dimensions creates minimal enhanced diffusion. The theory for the phenomena mentioned above is elementary yet mathematically rigorous. Examples are emphasized throughout this work including a discussion of enhanced diffusivity for a class of flows recently introduced by Childress and Soward [8]. The theory developed here is also supplemented by a series of numerical experiments that both verify the theoretical predictions and display interesting crossover phenomena at rather large but finite Peclet numbers.},

The difference in mass density between fluid and particles is assumed to be small, and represents the basic parameter for a regular perturbative expansion. By means of analytical techniques such as Hermitianization, we derive a chain of equations of the advection-diffusion-reaction type, easily solvable at least numerically. Our procedure provides results also for finite particle inertia, away from the over-damped limit of quasi-tracer dynamics.},

The ergodicity of SDEs is established by using techniques from the theory of Markov chains on general state spaces, such as that expounded by Meyn–Tweedie. Application of these Markov chain results leads to straightforward proofs of geometric ergodicity for a variety of SDEs, including problems with degenerate noise and for problems with locally Lipschitz vector ÿelds. Applications where this theory can be usefully applied include damped-driven Hamiltonian problems (the Langevin equation), the Lorenz equation with degenerate noise and gradient systems.},

Such particles commonly exhibit what is known as anomalous subdiffusion, which is to say that their position mean-squared displacement (MSD) scales sublinearly with time. While it is common in the literature to observe that there is a relationship between the MSD and the memory structure of the GLE, and that there exist special cases where explicit solutions exist, this connection has never been fully characterized. Here, we establish a class of memory kernels for which the GLE is well-defined, we investigate the associated regularity properties of solutions, and we prove that large-time asymptotic behavior of the particle MSD is entirely determined by the tail behavior of the GLE’s memory kernel.},

The square of the radial component is a Wright-Fisher diffusion with mutation and it features in a skew-product decomposition of the projected spherical Brownian motion. A more general SDE on the unit ball in Rn+ allows us to geometrically realize the Wright-Fisher diffusion with general non-negative parameters as the radial component of its solution.},

In particular, we present a novel load balancing procedure that ensures scalability of the MLMC algorithm on massively parallel hardware. A new code ALSVID-UQ is described and applied to simulate uncertain solutions of the Euler equations and ideal MHD equations. Numerical experiments showing the robustness, efficiency and scalability of the proposed algorithm are presented.},

It was recently suggested that the unitarity of Schrödinger dynamics can be spontaneously broken, resulting in measurement as an emergent phenomenon in the thermodynamic limit. Here, we introduce a family of models for spontaneous unitarity violation that apply to generic initial superpositions over arbitrarily many states, using either single or multiple state-independent stochastic components. Crucially, we show that Born’s probability rule emerges spontaneously in all cases.},

  abstract     = {In this contribution, we develop a variational integrator for the simulation of (stochastic and multiscale) electric circuits. When considering the dynamics of an electric circuit, one is faced with three special situations: 1. The system involves external (control) forcing through external (controlled) voltage sources and resistors. 2. The system is constrained via the Kirchhoff current (KCL) and voltage laws (KVL). 3. The Lagrangian is degenerate. Based on a geometric setting, an appropriate variational formulation is presented to model the circuit from which the equations of motion are derived. A time-discrete variational formulation provides an iteration scheme for the simulation of the electric circuit. Dependent on the discretization, the intrinsic degeneracy of the system can be canceled for the discrete variational scheme. In this way, a variational integrator is constructed that gains several advantages compared to standard integration tools for circuits; in particular, a comparison to BDF methods (which are usually the method of choice for the simulation of electric circuits) shows that even for simple LCR circuits, a better energy behavior and frequency spectrum preservation can be observed using the developed variational integrator.},

  abstract  = {Artificial neural networks have revolutionized electronic computing. Similarly, molecular networks with neuromorphic architectures may enable molecular decision-making on a level comparable to gene regulatory networks1,2. Non-enzymatic networks could in principle support neuromorphic architectures, and seminal proofs-of-principle have been reported3,4. However, leakages (that is, the unwanted release of species), as well as issues with sensitivity, speed, preparation and the lack of strong nonlinear responses, make the composition of layers delicate, and molecular classifications equivalent to a multilayer neural network remain elusive (for example, the partitioning of a concentration space into regions that cannot be linearly separated). Here we introduce DNA-encoded enzymatic neurons with tuneable weights and biases, and which are assembled in multilayer architectures to classify nonlinearly separable regions. We first leverage the sharp decision margin of a neuron to compute various majority functions on 10\,bits. We then compose neurons into a two-layer network and synthetize a parametric family of rectangular functions on a microRNA input. Finally, we connect neural and logical computations into a hybrid circuit that recursively partitions a concentration plane according to a decision tree in cell-sized droplets. This computational power and extreme miniaturization open avenues to query and manage molecular systems with complex contents, such as liquid biopsies or DNA databases.},

The method we present in this paper is simple to formulate and to implement, and can be straightforwardly extended to higher dimensional conservation laws.

This slow evolution, referred to as aging, is deemed undesirable as it often leads to material degradation. However, we show that aging also encodes a memory of the stresses imposed during preparation. Because of inhomogeneous local stresses, the material itself decides how to evolve by modifying stressed regions differently from those under less stress. Because material evolution occurs in response to stresses, aging can be “directed” to produce sought-after responses and unusual functionalities that do not inherently exist. Aging obeys a natural “greedy algorithm” as, at each instant, the material simply follows the path of most rapid and accessible relaxation. Our experiments and simulations illustrate directed aging in examples in which the material’s elasticity transforms as desired because of an imposed deformation.},

  abstract     = {Nearly, all dense suspensions undergo dramatic and abrupt thickening transitions in their flow behavior when sheared at high stresses. Such transitions occur when the dominant interactions between the suspended particles shift from hydrodynamic to frictional. Here, we interpret abrupt shear thickening as a precursor to a rigidity transition and give a complete theory of the viscosity in terms of a universal crossover scaling function from the frictionless jamming point to a rigidity transition associated with friction, anisotropy, and shear. Strikingly, we find experimentally that for two different systems—cornstarch in glycerol and silica spheres in glycerol—the viscosity can be collapsed onto a single universal curve over a wide range of stresses and volume fractions. The collapse reveals two separate scaling regimes due to a crossover between frictionless isotropic jamming and frictional shear jamming, with different critical exponents. The material-specific behavior due to the microscale particle interactions is incorporated into a scaling variable governing the proximity to shear jamming, that depends on both stress and volume fraction. This reformulation opens the door to importing the vast theoretical machinery developed to understand equilibrium critical phenomena to elucidate fundamental physical aspects of the shear thickening transition.},

Drawing on the Feynman-Kac representation of the vorticity transport equation, we propose a recursive Monte Carlo estimator of the Biot-Savart law and extend it with a stream function formulation that allows us to treat free-slip boundary conditions using a Walk-on-Spheres algorithm. Inspired by the Monte Carlo literature in rendering, we design and compare variance reduction schemes suited to a fluid simulation context for the first time, show its applicability to complex boundary settings, and detail a simple and practical implementation with temporal grid caching. We validate the correctness of our approach via quantitative and qualitative evaluations – across a range of settings and domain geometries – and thoroughly explore its parameters’ design space. Finally, we provide an in-depth discussion of several axes of future work building on this new numerical simulation modality.

  abstract     = {Significance             Functionally optimized networks are ubiquitous in nature, e.g., in allosteric proteins that change conformation upon binding to a ligand or vascular networks that distribute oxygen and nutrients in animals or plants. Many of these networks are multifunctional, with proteins that can catalyze more than one substrate or vascular networks that can deliver enhanced flow to more than one localized region of the network. This work investigates the question of how many simultaneous functions a given network can be designed to fulfill, uncovering a phase transition that is related to other constraint–satisfaction transitions such as the jamming transition.           ,              Nature is rife with networks that are functionally optimized to propagate inputs to perform specific tasks. Whether via genetic evolution or dynamic adaptation, many networks create functionality by locally tuning interactions between nodes. Here we explore this behavior in two contexts: strain propagation in mechanical networks and pressure redistribution in flow networks. By adding and removing links, we are able to optimize both types of networks to perform specific functions. We define a single function as a tuned response of a single “target” link when another, predetermined part of the network is activated. Using network structures generated via such optimization, we investigate how many simultaneous functions such networks can be programed to fulfill. We find that both flow and mechanical networks display qualitatively similar phase transitions in the number of targets that can be tuned, along with the same robust finite-size scaling behavior. We discuss how these properties can be understood in the context of constraint–satisfaction problems.},

  abstract     = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) with spatially varying coefficients arise throughout science and engineering, modeling rich heterogeneous material behavior. Yet conventional PDE solvers struggle with the immense complexity found in nature, since they must first discretize the problem---leading to spatial aliasing, and global meshing/sampling that is costly and error-prone. We describe a method that approximates neither the domain geometry, the problem data, nor the solution space, providing the exact solution (in expectation) even for problems with extremely detailed geometry and intricate coefficients. Our main contribution is to extend the               walk on spheres (WoS)               algorithm from constant- to variable-coefficient problems, by drawing on techniques from volumetric rendering. In particular, an approach inspired by               null-scattering               yields unbiased Monte Carlo estimators for a large class of 2nd order elliptic PDEs, which share many attractive features with Monte Carlo rendering: no meshing, trivial parallelism, and the ability to evaluate the solution at any point without solving a global system of equations.},

  abstract      = {We introduce Equilibrium Propagation, a learning framework for energy-based models. It involves only one kind of neural computation, performed in both the first phase (when the prediction is made) and the second phase of training (after the target or prediction error is revealed). Although this algorithm computes the gradient of an objective function just like Backpropagation, it does not need a special computation or circuit for the second phase, where errors are implicitly propagated. Equilibrium Propagation shares similarities with Contrastive Hebbian Learning and Contrastive Divergence while solving the theoretical issues of both algorithms: our algorithm computes the gradient of a well defined objective function. Because the objective function is defined in terms of local perturbations, the second phase of Equilibrium Propagation corresponds to only nudging the prediction (fixed point, or stationary distribution) towards a configuration that reduces prediction error. In the case of a recurrent multi-layer supervised network, the output units are slightly nudged towards their target in the second phase, and the perturbation introduced at the output layer propagates backward in the hidden layers. We show that the signal ’back-propagated’ during this second phase corresponds to the propagation of error derivatives and encodes the gradient of the objective function, when the synaptic update corresponds to a standard form of spike-timing dependent plasticity. This work makes it more plausible that a mechanism similar to Backpropagation could be implemented by brains, since leaky integrator neural computation performs both inference and error back-propagation in our model. The only local difference between the two phases is whether synaptic changes are allowed or not. We also show experimentally that multi-layer recurrently connected networks with 1, 2 and 3 hidden layers can be trained by Equilibrium Propagation on the permutation-invariant MNIST task.},

  title    = {Energy-{{Based Learning Algorithms}} for {{Analog Computing}}: {{A Comparative Study}}},
  abstract = {Energy-based learning algorithms have recently gained a surge of interest due to their compatibility with analog (post-digital) hardware. Existing algorithms include contrastive learning (CL), equilibrium propagation (EP) and coupled learning (CpL), all consisting in contrasting two states, and differing in the type of perturbation used to obtain the second state from the first one. However, these algorithms have never been explicitly compared on equal footing with same models and datasets, making it difficult to assess their scalability and decide which one to select in practice. In this work, we carry out a comparison of seven learning algorithms, namely CL and different variants of EP and CpL depending on the signs of the perturbations. Specifically, using these learning algorithms, we train deep convolutional Hopfield networks (DCHNs) on five vision tasks (MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100). We find that, while all algorithms yield comparable performance on MNIST, important differences in performance arise as the difficulty of the task increases. Our key findings reveal that negative perturbations are better than positive ones, and highlight the centered variant of EP (which uses two perturbations of opposite sign) as the best-performing algorithm. We also endorse these findings with theoretical arguments. Additionally, we establish new SOTA results with DCHNs on all five datasets, both in performance and speed. In particular, our DCHN simulations are 13.5 times faster with respect to Laborieux et al. [2021], which we achieve thanks to the use of a novel energy minimisation algorithm based on asynchronous updates, combined with reduced precision (16 bits).},

GPT-2 (ref.\,               1               ), GPT-3(.5) (ref.\,               2               ) and GPT-4 (ref.\,               3               ) demonstrated high performance across a variety of language tasks. ChatGPT introduced such language models to the public. It is now clear that generative artificial intelligence (AI) such as large language models (LLMs) is here to stay and will substantially change the ecosystem of online text and images. Here we consider what may happen to GPT-\{               n               \} once LLMs contribute much of the text found online. We find that indiscriminate use of model-generated content in training causes irreversible defects in the resulting models, in which tails of the original content distribution disappear. We refer to this effect as ‘model collapse’ and show that it can occur in LLMs as well as in variational autoencoders (VAEs) and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We build theoretical intuition behind the phenomenon and portray its ubiquity among all learned generative models. We demonstrate that it must be taken seriously if we are to sustain the benefits of training from large-scale data scraped from the web. Indeed, the value of data collected about genuine human interactions with systems will be increasingly valuable in the presence of LLM-generated content in data crawled from the Internet.},

  abstract     = {The propagation of large amplitude nonlinear waves in a peridynamic solid is analyzed. With an elastic material model that hardens in compression, sufficiently large wave pulses propagate as solitary waves whose velocity can far exceed the linear wave speed. In spite of their large velocity and amplitude, these waves leave the material they pass through with no net change in velocity and stress. They are nondissipative and nondispersive, and they travel unchanged over large distances. An approximate solution for solitary waves is derived that reproduces the main features of these waves observed in computational simulations. It is demonstrated by numerical studies that the waves interact only weakly with each other when they collide. Wavetrains composed of many non-interacting solitary waves are found to form and propagate under certain boundary and initial conditions.},

However, students are not often introduced to alternative techniques, such as variational principles, for solving circuits. Many authors have tried to derive the steady-state distribution of currents in circuits from variational principles, and the initial attempts were carried out by great physicists, such as Kirchhoff, Maxwell and Feynman. In this article, we shall review such variational principles in physics and illustrate how they can be used to solve DC circuits. We will also explore how they are related, in a fundamental way, to the entropy production principles of irreversible thermodynamics. We believe that the introduction of variational alternatives for solving circuits can be a good opportunity for the instructor to present the techniques of the calculus of variations and irreversible thermodynamics to students.},

  abstract      = {Physical networks can develop diverse responses, or functions, by design, evolution or learning. We focus on electrical networks of nodes connected by resistive edges. Such networks can learn by adapting edge conductances to lower a cost function that penalizes deviations from a desired response. The network must also satisfy Kirchhoff's law, balancing currents at nodes, or, equivalently, minimizing total power dissipation by adjusting node voltages. The adaptation is thus a double optimization process, in which a cost function is minimized with respect to conductances, while dissipated power is minimized with respect to node voltages. Here we study how this physical adaptation couples the cost landscape, the landscape of the cost function in the high-dimensional space of edge conductances, to the physical landscape, the dissipated power in the high-dimensional space of node voltages. We show how adaptation links the physical and cost Hessian matrices, suggesting that the physical response of networks to perturbations holds significant information about the functions to which they are adapted.},

  abstract     = {The subject of inverse problems in differential equations is of enormous practical importance, and has also generated substantial mathematical and computational innovation. Typically some form of regularization is required to ameliorate ill-posed behaviour. In this article we review the Bayesian approach to regularization, developing a function space viewpoint on the subject. This approach allows for a full characterization of all possible solutions, and their relative probabilities, whilst simultaneously forcing significant modelling issues to be addressed in a clear and precise fashion. Although expensive to implement, this approach is starting to lie within the range of the available computational resources in many application areas. It also allows for the quantification of uncertainty and risk, something which is increasingly demanded by these applications. Furthermore, the approach is conceptually important for the understanding of simpler, computationally expedient approaches to inverse problems.},

We establish a new concept of a global solution for the diffusion approximation (Fokker–Planck equation), prove its existence and uniqueness and then show how one can easily derive all the essential properties of this random genetic drift process from our solution. Thus, our solution turns out to be superior to the local solution constructed by Kimura.},

Since students typically find the meaning and use of the junction theorem straightforward, but are prone to conceptual and computational difficulties with the loop theorem, we present here a little-known alternative method for solving dc circuit problems. In this method, the junction theorem is retained, but the use of the loop theorem is replaced by the minimization of a single global variational quantity for the circuit. In this paper, the variational method is described and its use is illustrated, and its equivalence to standard methods is proved by vector calculus from the steady-state limit of Maxwell’s equations.},

Two classes of methods are discussed, depending on the time interval on which the evolution of the slow variables in the system is sought. On rather short time intervals, the slow variables satisfy ordinary differential equations. On longer time intervals, however, fluctuations become important, and stochastic differential equations are obtained. In both cases, the numerical methods compute the evolution of the slow variables without having to derive explicitly the effective equations beforehand; rather, the coefficients entering these equations are obtained on the fly using short simulations of appropriate auxiliary systems.},

This paper explains how to derive the correct thermo-dynamic potential for electro-static phenomena, whether the voltage is fixed, or the charge is fixed, or some combination is fixed. In particular, we explain, in complete detail, why fixing the voltage introduces “a minus sign” in the electrical energy.},

  abstract     = {Natural selection and demographic forces can have similar effects on patterns of DNA polymorphism. Therefore, to infer selection from samples of DNA sequences, one must simultaneously account for demographic effects. Here we take a model-based approach to this problem by developing predictions for patterns of polymorphism in the presence of both population size change and natural selection. If data are available from different functional classes of variation, and               a priori               information suggests that mutations in one of those classes are selectively neutral, then the putatively neutral class can be used to infer demographic parameters, and inferences regarding selection on other classes can be performed given demographic parameter estimates. This procedure is more robust to assumptions regarding the true underlying demography than previous approaches to detecting and analyzing selection. We apply this method to a large polymorphism data set from 301 human genes and find (               i               ) widespread negative selection acting on standing nonsynonymous variation, (               ii               ) that the fitness effects of nonsynonymous mutations are well predicted by several measures of amino acid exchangeability, especially site-specific methods, and (               iii               ) strong evidence for very recent population growth.},

The homogenization of such equations is established in a 2016 paper of Armstrong, Tran and Yu for all continuous and coercive G. Under the extra condition that G is a double-well function (i.e., it has precisely two local minima), we give a new and fully constructive proof of homogenization which yields a formula for the effective Hamiltonian øverline H. We use this formula to provide a complete list of the heights at which the graph of øverline H has a flat piece. We illustrate our results by analyzing basic classes of examples, highlight some corollaries that clarify the dependence of øverline H on G, β and the law of V(\textbackslash cdot,ømega), and discuss a generalization to even-symmetric triple-well Hamiltonians.},
